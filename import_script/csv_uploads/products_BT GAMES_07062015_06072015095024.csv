Dante sets out on a rescue mission to save Beatrice, but he soon realizes he is also in Hell to face his own demons and ultimately to redeem himself.Players will take Dante through nine unique circles of Hell as mapped out and described by Alighieri: limbo, lust, gluttony, greed, anger, heresy, violence, fraud and treachery.

To take down the demons of Hell, Dante is outfitted with two primary weapons: the Scythe he takes from Death and the Holy Cross given to him by Beatrice, which has spiritual powers that will help Dante collect souls and spells from the creatures he defeats on his journey. The game also features a deep upgrade system so gamers can customize their abilities to their specific gameplay style, something they’ll need as Dante comes face to face with Hell’s fiercest beasts and bosses.

Witness the intensity of crowds chanting and cheering like on match day, and listen to commentators guide fans through the story of the game with Dynamic Match Presentation. For the first time ever, all 22 players on the pitch are connected with Emotional Intelligence – now players will react to opponents and teammates within the context, and relative to the narrative of the match. Next Generation Visuals put fans on Living Pitches with grass that wears and tears as the match progresses. Authentic Player Visuals make players lean, athletic, and true to their real-life appearance. Player Control heightens the responsiveness of player movement, gives athletes more control and personality on the ball, and makes Man-to-Man Battles more rewarding than ever before. Football is the greatest drama on earth and FIFA 15 puts fans center stage, allowing them to feel the emotion and intensity of the world’s greatest sport.Emotional Intelligence — For the first time ever, FIFA 15 models the emotions of all 22 players on the pitch, giving fans a chance to experience first-hand the attitudes and personalities of the world’s best football players during a match. Players now recognize situations that trigger an emotional response and react naturally based on the game context. For example, a player that is being repeatedly fouled by an opponent could confront that opponent depending on the severity of the challenge and context of the competition. Players will respond authentically with new reactions to decisions, bad tackles, missed chances, goals, and other pivotal moments throughout the game. There are over 600 potential emotional reactions that could play out over the course of a game.Dynamic Match Presentation — Match Day will feel more dynamic and alive than ever before – immersing you in the match action and never taking you out of the moment. With region specific behaviors, crowds will now be distinguished by cheers and chants designated to their club, league, country, or continent. Fans at Anfield in Liverpool feel and act differently than the fans at La Bombonera in Buenos Aires. Commentators will mention specific fan behavior triggered by unique fan moments like the Poznan or club songs. New Bench Reactions, 10 Player Goal Celebrations, ball boy animations, and contextual commentary will keep FIFA 15 fans engaged in the story of the match.Unrivalled IntelligenceTeam Tactics — Teams will now have contextual awareness of the game and will dynamically adjust their tactics according to the situation. For example, your opponent could be leading by a goal in the 88th minute and decide to hold the ball in the corner in an attempt to run down the clock. The end result is a more humanlike opponent that takes more risks when trailing, and potentially a more conservative approach when leading. Park the Bus, In the Mixer, and Time Wasting are just some of the Team Tactics fans will recognize in FIFA 15.Incredible VisualsAuthentic Player Visuals — The FIFA 15 development team created the Next Generation football player – ensuring players appear true to their physical form. An all-new physically-based rendering lighting system changes the way players look, ensuring users are able to see a level of detail in players’ faces which hasn’t been possible before. New body rigging and character models make players feel powerful and athletic, while kits move realistically and react with the environment becoming dirty with mud and grass as the match unfolds.Living Pitch — Pitches will never be the same. Slide tackles and boot marks are now visible on the pitch, and as the match progresses, the playing surface becomes increasingly weathered just as it would in a real football match. Fans playing in rain or wet weather will notice mud and debris on the pitch. Corner flag physics, goal frames that shake, and animated LED ad boards are just some of the new details that bring FIFA 15 to life.Player ControlAgility & Control — FIFA 15 adds an all new level of responsiveness and control. Run Touch Dribbling allows players to better keep the ball under control in a sprint and in close-touch situations, giving personality to the most recognized players in the world. Leo Messi will dribble and move like he does in real life. Updated player biomechanics means that players will now react and move with balance and closer control when in possession of the ball. More precise steps and turns at low speed, and closer control at high speeds give fans more control and increased mobility when commanding players on the pitch.Man-to-Man Battles — Dispossessing your opponent in FIFA 15 is more rewarding and physical than ever before. Players use Full-Body Defending to win possession and keep it. Possession Tackles will reward great defending, helping players keep the ball close to their feet when a challenge is won. New shoulder barges, push/pull mechanics, and big fall physics allow fans to feel the battle; shirt pulling is also visible thanks to new character visuals and improved cloth technology.Correct Contacts — Physically Correct Contacts revolutionizes the way the football interacts with the players and their environment. Every dribble, touch, pass, shot, and deflection moves corresponding to the spin of the ball in relation to the position of the body part or object that it connects with – this gives the football accurate spin, curl, and movement, as well as varied trajectories. The movement of the ball in FIFA 15 changes the game.Set Piece Control – FIFA 15 fans now have more freedom in attack with the ability to take control of teammates during throw-ins, corners, and free kicks. Using the right stick, FIFA fans can now control teammates off the ball to put them in the optimal spot to receive a pass during dead ball situations.</span></p>","3DS, Nintendo",FIFA 15 brings football to life in stunning detail so fans can experience the emotion of the sport like never before.,BT Games: Fifa 15,Publisher: T[Electronic Arts]; Publication Year: T[2014]; Has Adult Content: C[N]; Genre: T[Sports]; Format: S[Nintendo 3DS],,,FIFA 15 brings football to life in stunning detail so fans can experience the emotion of the sport like never before.,A

Your child will harness the power of mathematics and help the My Little Pony friends – Princess Twilight Sparkle, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Fluttershy – recover the Elements of Harmony and bring Equestria back into balance.Little learners use counting and part-whole relationships to help Applejack pack each Pony's saddle so she's balanced for her flight. Then they take to the air, using skill and smart timing to earn and collect stars. When more flight power is needed, they stop in at Rarity's fashion boutique to get the upgrades they need to succeed. Works with LeapPad Ultra, LeapPad2, LeapPad2 Power, LeapPad1, LeapsterGS, and Leapster Explorer systems (sold separately).Learning skillsA host of exciting new mathematics concepts are waiting in the magical land of Equestria. Children journey along with the ponies and use probability and mathematics to overcome obstacles and carry out the mission. They face off against Discord's doubles in learning mini-games; choose the spinner that will give the pony the most speed and endurance, and race to the finish line to win! Children use problem-solving skills and knowledge of operations to identify which animated equations will help solve word problems. They count apples and determine the probability that a selected colour will fall from the tree.Once they've helped the ponies complete their six journeys, it's time to celebrate friendship and pony power! The LeapFrog My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic learning game is designed to teach important early elementary mathematics skills in an interactive play environment, and is appropriate for children aged 5 to 8 years old.The LeapFrog differenceMy Little Pony Friendship Is Magic provides a curriculum rich in mathematics skills in the context of a fun adventure. The game is also designed to introduce children to the concept of probability and how to make decisions based on this concept through simple, illustrative activities that progress to provide a comfort level for your child.Early mathematical experiences are highly important for later academic achievement, and My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic brings together foundational skills such as addition and subtraction with extremely important but less familiar skills like probability, one of the most useful branches of mathematics. Studying probability can help children develop critical thinking skills and make informed decisions about the probability that surrounds them in the real world on a daily basis.Innovative learning approachDesigned by in-house educational experts, LeapFrog learning games are grounded in the latest research for the richest possible learning experience. As leaders in educational entertainment, LeapFrog combine innovation with a breadth of play patterns to delight and expand learning horizons. Inspired by school curriculum, My Little Pony uses charts, graphs, and diagrams to introduce probability, counting, addition and subtraction, multiplication, and percentages. For example, children learn to read pie charts to choose the fastest spinner, use counting and part-whole relationships to balance weight scales, and use problem-solving and knowledge of operations to identify animated equations that solve word problems.</span></p>","LeapFrog, Leap Frog",Spring into a high-flying learning adventure in My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic!,BT Games: My Little Pony,Publisher: T[LeapFrog]; Publication Year: T[2014]; Has Adult Content: C[N]; Genre: T[Family Fun]; Format: S[LeapFrog],,,Spring into a high-flying learning adventure in My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic!,A

Serve smiles and happy customers every day with Hello Kitty! Works with LeapPad Ultra, LeapPad2, LeapPad1, LeapsterGS, and Leapster Explorer systems (sold separately).Learning skills: As children move from one shop to another, they play mathematics games to complete quests and unlock all five themed days. They get busy filling orders, using charts, estimating the right size goody packages, and catching the correct ingredients to make tasty treats. Your little maths whiz will use estimation skills to guess how many jellybeans are in the jar and create a chart to figure out the favorite flavor of the day.Children earn stickers and even put a Hello Kitty twist on the photos they take with the built-in camera on LeapPad learning tablets and LeapsterGS. Every level is a new day packed full of fun and reward, and with up to ten themed quests there's always something new to learn and discover! Core skills taught include tables, charts and graphs, estimation, number sense, and sorting and classifying.The LeapFrog difference: LeapFrog has created a playful learning environment that is developmentally appropriate for children aged 4 to 7 years old. A robust, diverse title for developing mathematicians, Hello Kitty Sweet Little Shops brings together foundational skills such as number recognition and shape knowledge with equally important but less familiar skills such as estimation and reading tables, charts, and graphs. The game is set in recognisable, lifelike scenarios, showing children that mathematics is all around them and is important for real life.Innovative learning approach: Hello Kitty Sweet Little Shops provides a curriculum rich in maths-related subjects that explore the estimation of both quantity and space. New concepts are presented in ways familiar to children so that they can generalise their game experiences to the real world. An estimation task asks children to estimate how many jellybeans are in a jar and a chart exercise has children interpret various types of charts and fill the appropriate number of items through a fun play pattern.</span></p>","LeapFrog, Leap Frog","Help Hello Kitty keep the Sweet Little Shops running smoothly!
